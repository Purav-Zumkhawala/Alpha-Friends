Amy. You've got to stop doing that. Monica about to have a heart attack: Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this."], ["Monica Geller", "Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun."], ["Amy Green", "Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby?"], ["Chandler Bing", "No, if crazy plate lad.. If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?"], ["Rachel Green", "Well actually..."], ["Chandler Bing", "Actually what?"], ["Ross Geller", "well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents."], ["Chandler Bing", "What?"], ["Amy Green", "Hurts, doesn't it?"], ["Joey Tribbiani", "Uh.. who has to die for me to get her?

He looked down."], ["Chandler Bing", "Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!"], ["Rachel Green", "Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent."], ["Ross Geller", "Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict."], ["Monica Geller", "Thats not how you see me, is it? Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you're all about the fun."], ["Chandler Bing", "Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?"], ["Ross Geller", "No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together."], ["Chandler Bing", "Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die she'd have to give her up."], ["Ross Geller", "Sure, Monica would have to give her up."], ["Joey Tribbiani", "I lie better then that, right?"], ["Chandler Bing", "So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?"], ["Phoebe Buffay", "There's your movie! Later on. Monica opens her front door. Chandler is sitting in the hallway."], ["Monica Geller", "Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner."], ["Chandler Bing", "Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?"], ["Monica Geller", "Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom."], ["Chandler Bing", "Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be."], ["Monica Geller", "No you learn these things. You grow into it."], ["Chandler Bing", "Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it."], ["Monica Geller", "I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts."], ["Chandler Bing", "Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying \"Go to your room! You're grounded\"?"], ["Monica Geller", "Can you hear me say \"You're grounded\"?"], ["Chandler Bing", "You said that to me last week."], ["Monica Geller", "How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture. Back to Monica and Chandler's apartment. Amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad. Joey groans and gets off the phone: The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. And they all got to meet Santa!"], ["Phoebe Buffay", "It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency."], ["Joey Tribbiani", "Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency."], ["Phoebe Buffay", "Ooh, what happened? Joey all nervous and looking down and fiddling with his ear: Oh.. My sister's raccoon."], ["Phoebe Buffay", "No! Nothing with a raccoon."], ["Joey Tribbiani", "Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. Monica and Chandler come through the front door."], ["Monica Geller", "Oh wait.. What are you doing?"], ["Joey Tribbiani", "Setting the table."], ["Phoebe Buffay", "Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too."], ["Monica Geller", "Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. Ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. He goes to Chandler."], ["Ross Geller", "Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before."], ["Chandler Bing", "Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok. Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch. Uchh In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you."], ["Rachel Green", "UCHH!"], ["Amy Green", "You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel."], ["Rachel Green", "Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?"], ["Amy Green", "This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer."], ["Rachel Green", "What? What carrer?"], ["Amy Green", "Um.. I'm a decorator."], ["Rachel Green", "Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear."], ["Amy Green", "Why can't you ever be supportive?"], ["Rachel Green", "Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby."], ["Amy Green", "Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in the hospital when I was getting my lips done."], ["Rachel Green", "I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you."], ["Ross Geller", "Emma."], ["Rachel Green", "Oh whose side are you on? I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child."], ["Amy Green", "How hard could it be? You do it."], ["Joey Tribbiani", "ooh oooh.."], ["Amy Green", "Do you want to know why you don't want me to have the baby?"], ["Rachel Green", "uh huh."], ["Amy Green", "Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have always been jealous of me."], ["Rachel Green", "Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?"], ["Amy Green", "Uh.. To name a few. You know.. You know.. You've just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me?"], ["Rachel Green", "Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!"], ["Amy Green", "Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it."], ["Rachel Green", "I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today."], ["Amy Green", "Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail."], ["Rachel Green", "ah ha ha. ah ha ha. It's forty five."], ["Amy Green", "You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment. Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute."], ["Ross Geller", "Too far, Amy. Too far."], ["Rachel Green", "You take that back."], ["Amy Green", "No."], ["Rachel Green", "Take it back!"], ["Amy Green", "No! What are you going to do? Make me?"], ["Rachel Green", "Heey man, I work out."], ["Amy Green", "So do I."], ["Rachel Green", "I do pilates."], ["Amy Green", "I do yoga."], ["Rachel Green", "Bring it on!"], ["Monica Geller", "Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!"], ["Rachel Green", "Did you just push me?"], ["Amy Green", "Uh, yeah I think I did."], ["Rachel Green", "Alright. Thats it!"], ["Monica Geller", "Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time! Rachel starts messing up Amy's hair: Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!"], ["Phoebe Buffay", "Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?"], ["Joey Tribbiani", "What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them."], ["Rachel Green", "Ew! Gross."], ["Chandler Bing", "Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now."], ["Amy Green", "I'm sorry."], ["Rachel Green", "Mon, I'm so sorry."], ["Chandler Bing", "Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it."], ["Amy Green,Rachel Green", "Sorry."], ["Chandler Bing", "By the way, that fight was totally arousing."], ["Ross Geller", "Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma."], ["Chandler Bing", "Oh yeah? Well thanks."], ["Ross Geller", "So, so now do I get Joey?"], ["Chandler Bing", "Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose."], ["Rachel Green", "Are you okay Mon?"], ["Monica Geller", "uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died."], ["Phoebe Buffay", "It's all right. You can mourn."], ["Monica Geller", "Thank you. It was so beautiful. I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies."], ["Joey Tribbiani", "Actually its not pies, its just pie."], ["Monica Geller", "I don't care. Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold."], ["Rachel Green", "Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you.."], ["Amy Green", "So you're going to give me the baby?"], ["Rachel Green", "Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount."], ["Amy Green", "You are not going to regret this."], ["Rachel Green", "She needs changing."], ["Chandler Bing", "Oh no no no.. I'll get her.
